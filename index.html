    <h1>Campus Shut Down Due to Professor's Menacing T-Posing</h1>
    <p>
      In a strange and unprecedented turn of events, the EPITA campus has been
      shut down due to the T-posing of one of the professors, Mr. Caire. The
      campus director, Lionel Brosius, sent out several messages to students and
      faculty explaining the situation and warning them to stay away from the
      main entrance to the campus, where Mr. Caire has been standing and
      T-posing without moving.
    </p>

    <p>
      According to the messages, Mr. Caire has become increasingly violent and
      has injured several individuals, including Mr. Brosius himself. The
      authorities have been called in to address the situation and the campus
      has been closed until further notice.

    <hr />

    <p>The government recently released a statement regarding the situation:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <em>
        <p>Attention all citizens:</p>

        <p>
          We are issuing a warning regarding a dangerous situation that has
          developed on the EPITA campus. A individual by the name of Mr. Caire
          has taken to standing in front of the main entrance to the campus and
          T-posing in a very menacing manner, without moving. He has injured
          several individuals and has threatened to T-pose on any intruders.
        </p>
        <p>
          We strongly advise all citizens to avoid the area and not to approach
          Mr. Caire under any circumstances. The authorities are working to
          address the situation and will provide updates as soon as they become
          available.
        </p>
        <p>Please stay safe and heed this warning.</p>

      Philippe Bouchet, a student at EPITA, had this to say during a TV
      interview:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>Interviewer:</strong> Good evening, Philippe. Can you tell us
        what happened on the EPITA campus today?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Philippe Bouchet:</strong> Good evening. Yes, it was a very
        strange and unsettling day on campus. I was walking to class when I saw
        Mr. Caire standing in front of the main entrance, T-posing in a very
        menacing way. It was very strange and I had no idea what was going on.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> What happened next?</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Philippe Bouchet:</strong> Well, I tried to stay as far away as
        possible and avoided the main entrance. I heard later that Mr. Caire had
        become violent and injured several people, including the campus
        director, Lionel Brosius. It was really scary and I'm just glad that I
        wasn't close enough to get caught up in it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Interviewer:</strong> How have the authorities responded to the
        situation?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Philippe Bouchet:</strong> They've closed the campus until
        further notice and are working to address the situation. I'm not sure
        exactly what's going on, but I hope that they can find a resolution
        soon. It's just a really strange and unsettling situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Interviewer:</strong> Thank you, Philippe, for sharing your
        experiences with us today. We'll continue to follow this story and bring
        you updates as they become available.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Philippe Bouchet:</strong> Thank you.</p>

      It is not yet clear what has led to Mr. Caire's strange behavior or when
      the campus will reopen. We will continue to follow this story and provide
      updates as they become available. In the meantime, we advise all students
      and faculty to stay safe and avoid the area.
