Dear EPITA students,

I am writing to inform you that there will be no classes today due to an unexpected and highly unusual situation on campus. Mr. Caire, one of our esteemed professors, has taken to standing in front of the main entrance to the campus and T-posing in a very menacing manner, without moving.

While we are not sure of the reasons behind this behavior, we are taking every precaution to ensure the safety and well-being of our students, staff, and faculty. Therefore, we have decided to cancel all classes for the day.

We will continue to monitor the situation and will provide updates as soon as they become available. In the meantime, please stay safe and avoid the main entrance to the campus.

Sincerely,

Lionel Brosius
Campus Director, EPITA



Dear EPITA students,

I am writing to update you on the situation on campus regarding Mr. Caire's menacing T-posing. Unfortunately, while attempting to peacefully resolve the situation, Mr. Caire became increasingly violent and ultimately injured myself and several other individuals.

Given the escalating nature of the situation, and out of an abundance of caution for the safety of all students, staff, and faculty, we have decided to close the campus until further notice. All classes and activities are cancelled until further notice.

We are working with local authorities to address the situation and will provide updates as soon as they become available. In the meantime, please stay safe and avoid the campus until further notice.

Sincerely,

Lionel Brosius
Campus Director, EPITA



I am writing to inform you that I, Mr. Caire, will continue to stand here T-posing in front of the main entrance to the campus, without moving, for eternity. Any intruders who dare to enter the campus will be met with my menacing T-pose and will be dealt with accordingly.

I will not be swayed or deterred by any attempts to remove me or resolve this situation peacefully. I stand firm in my T-pose and will not be moved.

Consider yourselves warned.

Sincerely,

Mr. Caire
